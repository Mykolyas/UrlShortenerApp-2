    <h4>About the URL Shortening Algorithm</h4>
    <p>
        This URL shortener works by taking a long URL and generating a short URL, which is a compressed version of the original URL. The short URL redirects to the original URL when accessed. The system uses a GUID-based algorithm to generate unique short URLs. Each shortened URL is stored in a database along with its corresponding original URL and additional metadata, such as creation date and the user who created it.
    </p>

    <h5>How It Works:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>When a user inputs a long URL, the system checks if it already exists in the database.</li>
        <li>If it exists, the system returns the corresponding short URL.</li>
        <li>If it doesn't exist, the system creates a new short URL using a GUID and stores the mapping.</li>
        <li>Users can share the short URL, which will redirect them to the original long URL.</li>
    </ul>

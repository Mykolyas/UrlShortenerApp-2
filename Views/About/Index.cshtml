    <h4>About the Algorithm</h4>
    <p>
        This URL shortener works by taking a long URL and generating a short URL.
        The short URL is a compressed version of the original URL that redirects to the
        original URL when accessed. The system uses a base62 encoding algorithm to generate
        the short URL. Each shortened URL is stored in a database with its corresponding
        original URL and additional metadata like creation date and user who created it.
    </p>

    <h5>How It Works:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>When a user inputs a long URL, the system checks if it already exists in the database.</li>
        <li>If it exists, the system will return the corresponding short URL.</li>
        <li>If it doesn't exist, the system will create a new short URL and store the mapping.</li>
        <li>Users can share the short URL, which will redirect them to the original long URL.</li>
    </ul>

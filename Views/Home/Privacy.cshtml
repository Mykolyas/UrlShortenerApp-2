        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the Short URL App Privacy Policy page. We know you’re here for a good time, not a long time, but we’re still serious about your privacy!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
        <h3>What We Collect</h3>
        <p>We don’t track your favorite pizza toppings or your Netflix history (we’re not that creepy). But we do collect some basic info to make your experience smoother:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short URLs:</strong> We’ll remember the URLs you shorten. Don’t worry, we won’t judge if it’s a meme or a cat video link.</li>
            <li><strong>Your email (if you sign up):</strong> Just so we can keep you posted on how awesome we’re making the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But we never ask for your favorite color, pet’s name, or your secret cookie recipe!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
        <h3>What We Don’t Collect</h3>
        <p>We don’t collect any sensitive info (like your shoe size or what’s under your bed).</p>
        <p>No, we don’t have access to your browser history. We’re not in the mood to learn about your late-night shopping habits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
        <h3>Cookies? Oh Yes, Please!</h3>
        <p>We use cookies to enhance your experience – but not the kind you dip in milk. These cookies help us remember your session, so you don’t need to re-enter your data each time you visit. And yes, they’re tasty… metaphorically speaking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
        <h3>How We Use Your Info</h3>
        <p>We use your data to improve the service, to keep track of your shortened links, and to keep things running smoothly. But rest assured, we’ll never share your info with any shady characters (we’re too busy shortening URLs).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
        <h3>Your Rights</h3>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Request your data:</strong> Just let us know, we’ll send over the list of URLs you’ve shortened – we know, it’s pretty cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete your account:</strong> No hard feelings. If you ever feel like letting go of those sweet, sweet links, we’ll say goodbye with a virtual hug.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
